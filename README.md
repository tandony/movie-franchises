# TMDB Movie Franchises
An analysis of movie franchises using TMDB's API


## Summary
This project sought to explore the landscape of the franchise film market. Using data pulled from the popular site, The Movie Database, I analyzed a variety of attributes of films and their respective franchises. I looked at the relationships between factors such as budget, revenue, genre, and user engagement. I arrived at a “success equation” that defines the ultimate revenue-generating franchise. Future exploration will include a predictive model and digging deeper into audience demographics.
